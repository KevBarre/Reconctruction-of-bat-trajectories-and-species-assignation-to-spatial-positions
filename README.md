# Reconctruction of bat trajectories and species assignation to spatial positions
This repository proposes a reconstruction of bat trajectories from spatial positions previously collected applying trigonometry equations to time difference of echolocation call arrivals (TDOA) between differents microphones (01_trajectoryReconstruction.R). After that, a second step assigns automatically identified species (from raw sound files used to compute spatial coordinates) to each position (from any automated identification software, here Tadarida software) (02_autoIdentificationMatch.R). Here we do not present a method to compute spatial coordinates (see Ing et al. 2016 for that), but only how to group positions which come from a same trajectory, and link a species assignation from a file containing automatically identified bat passes.
